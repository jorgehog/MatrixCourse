\section*{Schur decomposition}
matrix A can be expressed as similar transform of matrix U:

$$A = QUQ^-1$$

where U is upper triangular and is called the Schur form of A.
Q is unitary, and U is upper diagonal, which means the eigenvalues of A will be on the diagonal of U. Find Schur decomp = expose eigenvalues. 

\section*{Real analog of power method (7.3.1)}

(7.4.1) is a real analog to the power method of finding eigenvalues. At a stage ($H_k=R_kU_k$), the machinery breaks down for matrices having complex eigenvalues. We must therefore calculate this term in a different way, namely by a \textit{real Schur decomposition}.

\section*{Real Schur Decomposition}

It is block upper diagonal. In the case of complex eigenvalues, the diagonal consists of 2x2 block matrices with complex conjugate eigenvalues. 

\section*{Hessenberg QR step}

The term $H_k=R_kU_k$ from the first section can now be calculated efficiently (order of magniute O(2) instead of O(3)) if we initialize the calculation with a matrix ($H_0$) on Hessenberg form (see next section).

\section*{The Hessenberg reduction}

It reads

$$U_0^TAU_0 = H$$
